        <script type="text/javascript">
            //alert( hello world );//html tags don't work in alert function 
            //javascript is an interpreted language, dynamic, loosely typed...semicolon is not mandatory but if you want to write multiple lines of code then u can use it.
            //loosely typed means you don't have to declare data type and dynamic means javascript itself decides the data type likee python.
            // client/browser side is the front-end and server side is the backend.
            // Identifier(name of variable,function, etc) should not be predefined character.
            //Variables of primitive data type
            var x = 9;//number
            var name = "Auroshis";//String
            var y = true;//Boolean
            /*document.write("<h1> hello world hey </h1>\n");
            document.write(name+"\n");
            document.write(y);*/
            //The associativity of the operators is from left to right in  case of arithmetic and concatenation.
            //function
            function add(a,b){
                var total = a+b;
                //document.write("sum "+total);

            add(2,1);
            //It's not mandatory to use "var" keyword but if you use var keyword it automatically becomes global variable.
            //Local variables are variables which are limited to a function.
            //There is a strict mode in browsers due to which global variables declared inside a function without var keyword can't be accessed.
            //arrays
            //arrays in javascript are similar to python lists, indexing starts from 0
            /*var arr = ['auro',1,2];//push pop is used instead of add remove
            for(var i =0;i<arr.length;i++){
                document.write(arr[i]);
            }*/
            //Objects
            //the syntax of similar to dictionary in python
